    "### *Two ways of doing the same thing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer. If you open the current directory using your operating system’s graphical file explorer, the **thesis** directory will appear there too. While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files, the files and directories themselves are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Good names for files and directories*\n",
    "Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful tips for the names of your files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t use spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spaces can make a name more meaningful, but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use **-** or **_** instead (e.g. **north-pacific-gyre/** rather than **north pacific gyre/**). To test this out, try typing **mkdir north pacific gyre** and see what directory (or directories!) are made when you check with **ls -F**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t begin the name with **-** (dash).\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands treat names starting with **-** as options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stick with letters, numbers, **.** (period or ‘full stop’), **-** (dash) and **_** (underscore).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other characters have special meanings on the command line. We will learn about some of these during this lesson. There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can even result in data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes (**\"\"**).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a text file\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Which Editor?*\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say, ‘nano is a text editor’ we really do mean ‘text’. It can only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS), many programmers use Emacs or Vim (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as Gedit or VScode. On Windows, you may wish to use Notepad++. Windows also has a built-in editor called notepad that can be run from the command line in the same way as nano for the purposes of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer’s start menu, it may want to save files in your Desktop or Documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you ‘Save As…’\n",

This is just a convention; we can call a file **mythesis** or almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the filename extension and indicates what type of data the file holds: **.txt** signals a plain text file, **.pdf** indicates a PDF document, **.cfg** is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, **.png** is a PNG image, and so on.\n",

Let’s consider the **shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes** directory: **\\*.pdb** represents **ethane.pdb**, **propane.pdb**, and every file that ends with ‘.pdb’. On the other hand, **p\\*.pdb** only represents pentane.pdb and propane.pdb, because the ‘p’ at the front can only represent filenames that begin with the letter ‘p’.\n",

    "When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the preceding command. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example, typing **ls \\*.pdf** in the **alkanes** directory (which contains only files with names ending with **.pdb**) results in an error message that there is no file called **\\*.pdf**. However, generally commands like **wc** and **ls** see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that expands the wildcards.\n",
